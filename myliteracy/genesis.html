Although I have seen many changes and improvements to technology, I will never know of a time without computers. With that being said, computers and technology have been an integral part of my life since I was a child. Throughout my life, there is one story that my dad keeps bringing up. When I was 3 years old, we had a family computer in the living room that my mom, my dad, and my sister used. On this large desktop, running Windows 95, my dad had downloaded a program called Napster. This program/service had a database of music that was able to be downloaded for free to any personal computer. Being the child that I was, loving the Disney movies that we had on VHS tapes, I really wanted to download the soundtrack of <i>The Lion King</i>. <a href="#" title="With song in my heart..." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="I still have song in my heart. As I sit here writing this, I am listening to the Lion King soundtrack and joyfully singing ðŸŽ¶ Hakuna Matata. It means no worries for the rest of your days ðŸŽ¶" data-placement="top">With song in my heart</a>, I took to the computer and attempted to download the soundtrack. Using my comparative skills, I looked at the VHS box and the computer keyboard, and carefully typed out <div id="lionking-textbox" class="form-control input-sm"><span id="lionking" type="typing" value="LION KING"></span></div>
              <br><br>
              Let me just say that my parent's weren't in the room when this was happening and in fact, they didn't realize that it was I who had downloaded the soundtrack of <em>The Lion King</em>. Initially, when my dad saw that the music had been downloaded, he assumed that my mom was the one to download it for me, however, upon asking if it was her, she told him that she had not. He then went on to question my sister to which she replied, "I didn't download it." Then my dad realized, after noticing the VHS box sitting next to the computer, that it was his little 3-year-old toddler who had used the computer to download the music he wanted, without even knowing how to read. It was from this moment that my parents first saw the computer literacy that I was beginning to develop. </div>

              So how <strong><em>DID</em></strong> I begin to acquire this literacy at such a young age? How did I know how to use a computer mouse and keyboard, how to navigate the operating system, and use a computer program without any formal instruction. I can only assume that from watching my parents and being around them when they used the computer, I was able to pick up and learn the skills necessary to use the computer. Because of this interaction, and the manner in which I acquire knowledge by merely being in the presence of my parents using the computers, computer literacy is a part of my primary discourse (Gee)<a href="references.html" class="reference">[2]</a>; the fact that I was able to use a computer before even knowing how to read and write clearly gives evidence to support this. Computer and technological literacy has become a normality of being part of the primary discourses of children born after the 1990s; for people born during the 1990's, less than half of households in the United States had computers (Census)<a class="reference" href="references.html">[3]</a>, and thus, computer literacy was not part of primary discourses for many children.

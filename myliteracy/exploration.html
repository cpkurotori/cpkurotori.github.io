          The constant exposure to technology and computers instilled in me a confidence to use such devices. This confidence allowed me to freely work with the computers without hesitation. When something happened on the computer that made it perform differently than intended, I would be able to change settings and try different solutions without a fear that the computer would break. Many times I would even use Google to help me solve a problem. Because I was unafraid to try alternate methods, I learned more and more about computers and became better at troubleshooting problems. I became so proficient with figuring out solutions that when my aunt and uncle experiences issues with their technology, they would call me to come fix it.

              Come sixth grade, I found out that my middle school offers a laptop program, in which students would be enrolled in specific classes that would integrate laptops with classroom instruction. This was my first real exposure to using computers in an academic setting, other than just using one to type an assignment here and there. Gee defines literacy as “control of secondary uses of language (i.e. uses of language in secondary discourses)” (Gee). Since academia is one of my secondary discourses, introducing the “language” of computers, and by language I mean the ability to utilize and incorporate computers, developed my computer and technological literacy. I was able to bring this aspect of my primary discourse into the classroom and effectively learn how to control it. Many times in classes, we would take notes using our computers. Interestingly, taking notes was foreign to me (I never had to take notes during elementary school) so learning to take notes and on a computer was a process.

              This involved learning how to take in information, comprehend it, and then synthesize it all the while learning how to type efficiently and use word processing software to format a document. Thankfully, because the nature of the laptop program was to teach this computer literacy to students, there were many resources available, such as a designated teacher who would help students with their technical problems. Additionally, many teachers would encourage the use of taking notes in the Cornell style and templates for this style were provided. At this point, taking notes and using a word processor were all within my Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky). Through the teacher’s efforts of scaffolding by taking us step by step through the process of using word processors and introducing tools to use, I was able to advance my knowledge of technology and computers until it became a part of my actual development. In Vygotsky’s article about the concept of Zone of Proximal Development, he says “what is in the zone of proximal development today will be the actual developmental level tomorrow - that is, what a child can do with assistance today she will be able to do by herself tomorrow” (Vygotsky). The fact that at first exposure I wasn’t comfortable with using word processors and taking notes and now I can fluently do so without the assistance of others gives credence to this statement.

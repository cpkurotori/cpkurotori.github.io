          I believe that computer and technological literacy is multi-faceted. Along with that thought, I think that most people nowadays naturally become literate in using computers and technology because of the importance our society places on these digital devices and tools. However, I would go as far to say that the average person only obtains the “basic literacy.” In this context, obtaining a basic literacy in computers and technology takes on the form of literacy as adaptation (Scribner)<a class="reference" href="references.html" data-toggle='tooltip' title='Scribner, Sylvia. “Literacy in Three Metaphors.” American Journal of Education, vol. 93, no. 1, 1984, pp. 6–21. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1085087.'>[2]</a>. I would even say that this basic literacy, in our society, has become sort of a “vital literacy” or “vital discourse” in which being able to function in society requires some form of knowledge on how to use digital devices. If you look in any workplace or social context, more often than not you will find that use of technology comes with the territory. Even elementary schools are starting to formally teach computer literacy so as to assist students in obtaining literacy in this vital discourse.

              After my years of experience with computers and mastering the “basic literacy” of computers, as I entered college, and needing to choose a path of study, I decided to pursue an education in computer science and gain a more advanced literacy of technology. In the past two years I have learned so much and my knowledge of computers has expanded tenfold. The process of learning how to program and how computers actually work has been really eye opening and actually really fun. Throughout my experience in the academic setting, I have found that I learn best on my own using online resources as well as “doing” as opposed to reading; this involves working on projects and assignments without reading the material beforehand, struggling, and finding a solution in the process of working.

              Moreover, it has been apparent that through personal projects, ones that truly interest me and motivate me, I have been able to further advance my knowledge and truly grasp the concepts and practices taught in the classroom. One program that I designed really captures this statement. After my first programming class at junior college, I only knew the basics of programming in the language of C++. My club needed a program that would be able to log and track member attendance, so as a little extracurricular project, I decided I would have a go at trying to make this program. Although there are many programs that already exist that could get the job done, probably even better than I implemented, I wanted to be able to learn and expand my knowledge by working on it myself. After coding for about 30 hours straight, I produced a product that worked!

          The pride that this project produced in me kindled my passion for Computer Science and programming and continues to motivate me to build upon my knowledge and actively seek new information that will improve my skills and set me up for a life of success ahead. It is, relatively, widely known that software engineers are highly sought after and that their salaries are fairly big. By obtaining the advanced literacy of computer programming, one begins to become a part of the dominant discourse of computer science and software engineering. Because of the high value in society and the fact that obtaining an education and literacy in computer programming can lead to the acquisition of societal goods (money), this is what makes this discourse dominant (Gee)<a class="reference" data-toggle="tooltip" title='Gee, James Paul. “LITERACY, DISCOURSE, AND LINGUISTICS: INTRODUCTION.” The Journal of Education, vol. 171, no. 1, 1989, pp. 18–25.

          From exposure to computers and technology in my dominant discourse, to learning to control the language in secondary discourses (Gee)<a class="reference" href="references.html" data-toggle="tooltip" title='Gee, James Paul. “LITERACY, DISCOURSE, AND LINGUISTICS: INTRODUCTION.” The Journal of Education, vol. 171, no. 1, 1989, pp. 18–25.

Mind in Society: the Development of Higher Psychological Processes.

JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1085087.'>[2]</a>, I have obtained computer and technological literacy and am now apart of a secondary, dominant, discourse of software engineering<a class="reference" href="references.html" data-toggle="tooltip" title='Gee, James Paul. “LITERACY, DISCOURSE, AND LINGUISTICS: INTRODUCTION.” The Journal of Education, vol. 171, no. 1, 1989, pp. 18–25. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42743865.'>[1]</a>. Because of the vitality of computer literacy in this ever advancing society, in a couple years, I don't think that my literacy story will be anything special (compared to the computer literacy that children in this generation are obtaining). The "advanced" literacy that I mentioned is slowly becoming the next "vital" literacy that everyone will be learning in primary school and there on -- it is already being taught in classes of third and fourth graders and it's only going to become more prevalent. I am proud to be a part of this discourse and I am excited to see where it will lead us.

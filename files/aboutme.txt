<h2>Cameron Kurotori</h2>

Hello, World! My name is Cameron Kurotori and I am a Fullstack Software Developer with IBM's <a href='https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/key-protect' target='_blank'>Key Protect</a> Team. I recently graduated with honors from the University of California, Berkeley, with a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). Go Bears!
<br>
While at Cal, I was an officer for the <a href='https://hkn.mu' target='_blank'>Mu Chapter of IEEE-HKN, the EECS Honors Society</a> and still actively participate in discussions as well as events that I am able to attend when I get the chance. I am deeply passionate about programming, if you couldn't already tell from this website, and spend much of my free time working on small personal projects. I have experience with Full Stack development but am also interested in Backend Application Development and Quality and Testing.
<br>
Additionally I am fascinated by the discipline of Computational Neuroscience, Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
<br>
Please have a look around at my website. I had a lot of fun creating it and I hope you enjoy exploring the different features I've coded in. Additionally all the code for this website is frontend and can be viewed in the source code.

<h3>Cameron Kurotori</h2>

Hello, World! My name is Cameron Kurotori and I am Junior pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at the University of California, Berkeley! Go Bears!
<br>
I am deeply passionate about programming, if you couldn't already tell from this website, and spend much of my free time working on small personal projects.
<br>
Additionally I am fascinated by the discipline of Computational Neuroscience, Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
<br>
Please have a look around at my website. I had a lot of fun creating it and I hope you enjoy exploring the different features I've coded in.
